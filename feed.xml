This type of argument suffers from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_quo_bias&quot;&gt;status quo bias&lt;/a&gt;, a “preference for the maintenance of one’s current state of affairs… or to not change this current state” to quote wikipedia. In other words, “This is how we have always done it and this is all we know so why change?”. To be fair, I dont necessarily blame people for having this bias, change can be discomforting, but we should always be aware of our bias for the current system, whatever that system may be, and become enlightened to alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The status quo bias is deeply rooted in many of our lives. We enter this world in ignorance and slowly form our reality from the experiences and knowledge handed to us by others, usually those in positions of authority. This, coupled with the propensity for K-12 schooling to snuff out curious minds who buck the system and beating children into obedience and conformity, makes for a populace who largely goes about their business without questioning. It takes an inquisitive mind to ask why things are the way they are but the kicker is that we are born curious. It is society, the state, religion, tradition, and capitalism that have taken our curiosity and supplanted it with subordination. In my opinion capitalism and indeed religion are the two forces most responsible for this and it makes sense: good workers are not those, to quote Tennyson, “to reason why” but “to do or die” (and to be back on the clock before their lunch break is over). And for religion, premised upon faith, good parishioners are those who take the word of scripture on faith, aka without critical inquiry or questioning. But the status quo bias is baked into social relationships of even smaller scales; “because I told you so” was a frequent retort made by my mother when I questioned something she told me to do. My point here is that the status quo bias is pervasive and permeates social institutions on all scales and it can be problematic since it blinds us to alternatives that could be in our best interest and makes us faithful adherents to positions that are supported on either slim or faulty logical grounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be aware of ones status quo bias presupposes that we are observant of the ways things are and subsequently ask ourselves why this state of affairs is the current one. Combating this bias requires skepticism and a knack for observation. Like Plato’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_cave&quot;&gt;allegory of the cave&lt;/a&gt;, to see the true nature of things requires us to become properly educated, and only through this education can we begin to start pondering.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">If you sit down with any capitalist or proponent thereof and lay forth the litany of cases against capitalism — its exploitative nature, irresponsible usage of natural resources, reduction of human values and meaning to numbers and money — they will undoubtably issue the following argument, or some version: What other system is there to increase wealth and improve the lives of others?

Wade Overturned" /><published>2022-06-24T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-06-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/daily-writing/2022/06/24/daily-writing</id><content type="html" xml:base="/daily-writing/2022/06/24/daily-writing.html">&lt;p&gt;Today the Supreme Court overturned Roe V. Wade. Seeing as how I likely wont be living in a red state in the future this decision wont necessarily impact me a ton, however, the impact this has on the civil liberties of women across the country is tremendous. That we, the United States, in the 21st century are still incapable of making progress on fundamental freedoms and liberties is deeply concerning. Religion is partly to blame for this. It is by its very nature conservative. Very little ground can be made in attempting to combat appeals made on religious grounds; as an unfalsifiable belief, it cannot be attacked on objective scientific grounds or be disproved. It stands on faith alone and is therefore impervious to reason and critical thought. Instead it is remains substantiated through confirmation bias and by binding itself to our personal identities such that any attack on religion, in the eyes of its believers, dissolves into an attack on the individual and their world view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If religion guides our policy and decision making, we will forever be subject to the capricious nature of religion. It is an ever changing belief system and one that cannot be consistently relied upon to guide us in making effective and just decisions in society. It lacks objectivism and is not only inconsistent but outdated in our modern age. I despise religion and unfortunately cannot but help to feel pity and sorrow for the believers of religion for they have been indoctrinated to hold beliefs without reflecting on the logical basis of said beliefs. To me, believers of religion comm egregious assumptions about the nature of reality and make far reaching claims that is not only unsubstantiated by science but defies even logic. Believers either seemingly deny the origin of religion as purely man made or brush it aside as irrelevant. Willful ignorance, blind faith. Most people I would imagine do not operate according to blind faith in any aspect of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I were to claim that god spoke to me and commanded me to kill an innocent bystander, what basis would religious people have for denying that? They claim to know gods will to the extent that they can no longer justify his actions on the basis of their own innate morality: “god’s plans are so much greater than anything I am capable of understanding”. On the basis of this, they would have no option but to believe me. How could they possible disprove my claim. If they say to me “the burden lies on me to prove that god spoke to me” I would counter by making that same argument in order to refute their claims that god even exist. Of course they do not see the fallacy in their reasoning. I’m getting bored writing about this. Suffice it to say that religion should have no place in our government or have no sway in our decision making. The Supreme Court’s decision today makes me want to leave this country since I know the worst has yet to come.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="daily-writing" /><summary type="html">Today the Supreme Court overturned Roe V.
