[x] Fix blog-search.js bug. Search functionality only works on /index since the 
 blog-search.js cant find the blog-post-database.json when the current page 
 is a post like /2022/daily-writing/ etc. Need a way to encode full path to 
 the .json file 

[] Add link to return to Recent Posts 
   that is more accessible when window is 
   smaller

[x] Modify Recent Posts heading so it 
   disappears when we enter a post

[] Finished implementing dark mode
[] See if browser can detect dark mode on users device and toggle dark mode
