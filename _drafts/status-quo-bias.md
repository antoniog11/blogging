title: Status Quo Bias
---
If you sit down with any capitalist or proponent thereof and lay forth the litany of cases against capitalism — its [exploitative nature][^1], irresponsible usage of natural resources[^2],reduction of human values and meaning to numbers and money —— they will undoubtably issue the following argument, or some version: "What other system is there to increase wealth and improve the lives of others?". My own personal issues with capitalism aside, and there are many, this type of argument for the maintenance of the current system of affairs, is used not only by capitalists but also reactionaries and conservatives who oppose efforts to enact social change as well as normal everyday people when they become disillusioned regarding the life they have always known. This type of argument suffers from the status quo bias, a "preference for the maintenance of one's current state of affairs... or to not change this current state" to quote wikipedia. In other words, "This is how we have always done it and this is all we know so why change?". To be fair, I dont necessarily blame people for having this bias, change can be discomforting, but we should always be aware of our bias for the current system, whatever that system may be, and become enlightened to alternatives. 

The status quo bias is deeply rooted in many of our lives. We enter this world in ignorance and slowly form our reality from the experiences and knowledge handed to us by others, usually those in positions of authority. This, coupled with the propensity for K-12 schooling to snuff out curious minds who buck the system and beating children into obedience and conformity, makes for a populace who largely goes about their business without questioning. It takes an inquisitive mind to ask why things are the way they are but the kicker is that we are born curious. It is society, the state, religion, tradition, and capitalism that have taken our curiosity and supplanted it with subordination. In my opinion capitalism and indeed religion are the two forces most responsible for this and it makes sense: good workers are not those, to quote Tennyson, "to reason why" but "to do or die" (and to be back on the clock before their lunch break is over). And for religion, premised upon faith, good parishioners are those who take the word of scripture on faith, aka without critical inquiry or questioning. But the status quo bias is baked into social relationships of even smaller scales; "because I told you so" was a frequent retort made by my mother when I questioned something she told me to do. My point here is that the status quo bias is pervasive and permeates social institutions on all scales and it can be problematic since it blinds us to alternatives that could be in our best interest and makes us faithful adherents to positions that are supported on either slim or faulty logical grounds. 

To be aware of ones status quo bias presupposes that we are observant of the ways things are and subsequently ask ourselves why this state of affairs is the current one. Combating this bias requires skepticism and a knack for observation. Like Plato's allegory of the cave[^3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_cave), to see the true nature of things requires us to become properly educated, and only through this education can we begin to start pondering.
