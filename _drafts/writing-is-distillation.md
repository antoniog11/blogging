title: writing is distillation
---
Writing is the act of distilling. To distill alcohol is to heat up a heterogenous mixture leaving behind only the purity that is alcohol. Writing is the same. We distil our thoughts, words, ideas. The distillation of an idea is so much harder when you sit down behind a keyboard or pick up a pen. Practice helps us perfect this craft.
